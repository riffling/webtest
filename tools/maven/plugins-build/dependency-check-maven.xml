                    autoUpdate:      Sets whether auto-updating of the NVD CVE/CPE data is enabled. It is not recommended that this be turned to false.  true
                    outputDirectory: The location to write the report(s). Note, this is not used if generating the report as part of a mvn site build  ‘target’
                    failBuildOnCVSS: Specifies if the build should be failed if a CVSS score above a specified level is identified. The default is 11 which means since the CVSS scores are 0-10, by default the build will never fail.  11
                    format:          The report format to be generated (HTML, XML, VULN, ALL). This configuration option has no affect if using this within the Site plugin unless the externalReport is set to true.  HTML
                    suppressionFile: The file path to the XML suppression file - used to suppress false positives   
                    skipTestScope:   Should be skip analysis for artifacts with Test Scope true
                    skipProvidedScope: Should be skip analysis for artifacts with Provided Scope false
                    skipRuntimeScope:  Should be skip analysis for artifacts with Runtime Scope

                    nexusAnalyzerEnabled  Sets whether Nexus Analyzer will be used. This analyzer is superceded by the Central Analyzer; however, you can configure this to run against a Nexus Pro installation. true
                    nexusUrl  Defines the Nexus Server’s web service end point (example http://domain.enterprise/service/local/). If not set the Nexus Analyzer will be disabled.
